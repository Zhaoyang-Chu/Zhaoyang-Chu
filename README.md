## Hi there 👋

🌟🌟 **I will be in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for [ICSE 2026](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2026) next April—looking forward to meeting many of you there!** 🤗🤗

🔭 I am an incoming PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at [**University College London (UCL)**](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), where I will begin my studies in Fall 2025, co-supervised by [**Prof. He Ye**](https://heye.me/) and [**Prof. Federica Sarro**](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/F.Sarro/).
Previously, I completed my master's degree at the School of Computer Science and Technology, [**Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)**](https://www.hust.edu.cn), advised by [**Prof. Yao Wan**](http://wanyao.me).
My academic journey has also been enriched by collaborations with [**Prof. Lingming Zhang**](https://lingming.cs.illinois.edu/) at UIUC and [**Prof. Hongyu Zhang**](https://sites.google.com/site/hongyujohn/) at Chongqing University.

> ✨ My research is inspired by the exciting frontiers at the intersection of **artificial intelligence** and **software engineering**, with a current focus on **multimodal coding agents**. I am passionate about building next-generation tools that make code smarter, more accessible, and more trustworthy.

😄 I am always eager to connect and collaborate—whether you share my interests or bring a different perspective from another field. If you’d like to discuss research, exchange ideas, or just say hi, feel free to reach out at [zychu418@gmail.com](mailto:zychu418@gmail.com).
