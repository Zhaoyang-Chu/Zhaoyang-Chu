## Hi there 👋

🌟🌟 **I will be in Vienna, Austria in September for ISSTA 2024! Hope to meet many of you there!** 🤗🤗

🔭 I am a second-year master’s student in the School of Computer Science and Technology at [**Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)**](https://www.hust.edu.cn), under the guidance of [**Prof. Yao Wan**](http://wanyao.me).

✨ **I am currently seeking a PhD position in SE/ML for Fall 2025.** For an overview of my academic background, please look at my [**CV**](https://zhaoyang-chu.github.io/assets/ZhaoyangChu_CV.pdf). If you are interested, please feel free to contact me: [chuzhaoyang@hust.edu.cn](mailto:chuzhaoyang@hust.edu.cn) \| [zychu418@gmail.com](mailto:zychu418@gmail.com).

😄 My research interest focuses on the intersection of **software engineering** and **machine learning**, where I am particularly intrigued by code intelligence, trustworthy artificial intelligence, and graph neural networks.
